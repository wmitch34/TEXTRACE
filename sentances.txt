For centuries, kings, queens and generals have relied on efficient communication in order to govern their countries and
command their armies. At the same time, they have all been aware of the consequences of their messages falling into the
wrong hands, revealing precious secrets to rival nations and betraying vital information to opposing forces. It was the threat
of enemy interception that motivated the development of
codes and ciphers: techniques for disguising a message so that
only the intended recipient can read it.
The desire for secrecy has meant that nations have operated
codemaking departments, which were responsible for ensuring
the security of communications by inventing and implementing the best possible codes. At the same time, enemy codebreakers have attempted to break these codes and steal secrets.
Codebreakers are linguistic alchemists, a mystical tribe attempting to conjure sensible words out of meaningless symbols. The history of codes and ciphers is the story of the
centuries-old battle between codemakers and codebreakers, an
intellectual arms race that has had a dramatic impact on the
course of history.
In writing The Code Book, I have had two main objectives.
The first is to chart the evolution of codes. Evolution is a
wholly appropriate term, because the development of codes can
be viewed as an evolutionary struggle. A code is constantly
under attack from codebreakers. When the codebreakers have
developed a new weapon that reveals a code’s weakness, then
the code is no longer useful. It either becomes extinct or it
evolves into a new, stronger code. In turn, this new code thrives
only until the codebreakers identify its weakness, and so on.
This is similar to the situation facing, for example, a strain of
infectious bacteria. The bacteria live, thrive and survive until
doctors discover an antibiotic that exposes a weakness in the
bacteria and kills them. The bacteria are forced to evolve and
outwit the antibiotic, and if successful, they will thrive once
again and reestablish themselves.History is punctuated with codes. They have decided the
outcomes of battles and led to the deaths of kings and queens.
I have therefore been able to call upon stories of political intrigue and tales of life and death to illustrate the key turning
points in the evolutionary development of codes. The history
of codes is so inordinately rich that I have been forced to leave
out many fascinating stories, which in turn means that my account is not definitive. If you would like to find out more about
your favorite tale or your favorite codebreaker, then I would refer you to the list of further reading.
Having discussed the evolution of codes and their impact on
history, the book’s second objective is to demonstrate how the
subject is more relevant today than ever before. As information
becomes an increasingly valuable commodity, and as the communications revolution changes society, so the process of encoding messages, known as encryption, will play an increasing
role in everyday life. Nowadays our phone calls bounce off
satellites and our e-mails pass through various computers, and
both forms of communication can be intercepted with ease, so
jeopardizing our privacy. Similarly, as more and more business
is conducted over the Internet, safeguards must be put in place

to protect companies and their clients. Encryption is the only
way to protect our privacy and guarantee the success of the digital marketplace. The art of secret communication, otherwise
known as cryptography, will provide the locks and keys of the
Information Age.
However, the public’s growing demand for cryptography
conflicts with the needs of law enforcement and national security. For decades, the police and the intelligence services
have used wiretaps to gather evidence against terrorists and
organized crime syndicates, but the recent development of ultrastrong codes threatens to undermine the value of wiretaps.
The forces of law and order are lobbying governments to restrict the use of cryptography, while civil libertarians and businesses are arguing for the widespread use of encryption to
protect privacy. Who wins the argument depends on which we
value more, our privacy or an effective police force. Or is there
a compromise?
Before concluding this introduction, I must mention a
problem that faces any author who tackles the subject of cryptography: The science of secrecy is largely a secret science.
Many of the heroes in this book never gained recognition for
their work during their lifetimes because their contribution
could not be publicly acknowledged while their invention was
still of diplomatic or military value. This culture of secrecy
continues today, and organizations such as the U.S. National
Security Agency still conduct classified research into cryptography. It is clear that there is a great deal more going on of
which neither I nor any other science writer is aware.
